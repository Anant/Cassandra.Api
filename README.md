## Setup

### 1.1 Create Account

- Before you start using our tools, you'll need to create an account on [DataStax Astra](https://dtsx.io/workshop)

![Astra](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/shared-assets/blob/master/astra/login-1000.png?raw=true)

### 1.2 Create New Database

- You'll then be directed to the home page. Locate the `Create Database` button on the left side:

- On the following screen, press the `Get Started` button underneath "Pay as you go":

- Enter a database name and keyspace name. Select any of the providers at the bottom and select the region closest to you. Then press `Create Database`

- Now wait a few minutes for the database to spin up, and click on the name of the database on the left side of the screen. Expected result:

Database is ready, notice how the status changed from `pending` to `Active` and now you now have the **connect** button enabled.*


### 1.3 Finding Secure Connect Bundle

- Get your secure connect bundle.
- Press the blue Connect button at the top right corner, and then select "Node.js" under the menu "Connect using a driver":

### 1.4 Download Secure Connect Bundle

- Finally, click the Download Bundle button to download the zip. Once saved, move the zip into the `cassandra.api/astra.credentials` directory of this project.

### 1.5 Generate Tokens For Database

- In the top left corner, press the arrow next to the "Current Organization" name and go to Organization Settings: 

![NikitaPic](Assets/Images/NikitaPic6.PNG)

- Navigate to Token Management, Select the role "Admin User" and press `Generate Token`. Expected result: 

![NikitaPic](Assets/Images/NikitaPic7.PNG)

- Before leaving this page, make sure to save these three values into a text document (or press the 'Download CSV' button)

### 1.6 Configure Cassandra.API Connection

- Fill in the naming conventions you declared earlier, when you setup your database, in your ***(cassandra.api/astra.credentials/UserCred.json) file***
- For Username, input your generated Client ID (from Token Management)
- For Password, input your generated Client Secret
- The following is an example of that the UserCred.json file would look like using the credentials used for configuring the Astra instance.

```
{ 
    "username":"your-client-id", 
    "password":"your-client-secret", 
    "cluster":"testdb2", 
    "keyspace":"testkeyspace", 
    "table":"leaves"
}
```

The last value ``table`` wasn't declared before so you can do that here for the first time.

## Getting Started

***It's best to go through this project in the following order so you do not get confused.***



### 2.1 Run the data migrator to transfer data from our cassandra.api to your Astra Database.

#### [Data Migrator](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.api/tree/master/astra.import)



### 2.2 Setup an API so that you can communicate with your Astra database. We have 2 APIs for you to use:


#### [Node JS](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.api/tree/master/astra.api/leaves.api.node)


#### [Python](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.api/tree/master/astra.api/leaves.api.python)



### 2.3 Run this set of unit tests against your API to confirm that it is working properly.

#### [Testing](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.api/tree/master/astra.api/leaves.api.tests)


### 2.4 Launch Web Admin UI to visualize your Astra Database in Table Format

#### [Admin UI](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.api/tree/master/astra.ui)
