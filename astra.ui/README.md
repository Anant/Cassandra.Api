# Astra UI
---
These instructions will get your CRUD UI, using Astra, up and running.
Before you start the admin UI, you'll need to run the Cassandra.API code including the Data Migrator and the either of the provided APIs (node or python).

## Getting Started (Locally & on Gitpod)

### Setup

**2.5.1** In this directory, add an `.env` file with the following content:

```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
REACT_APP_API_URL=
```
**PLEASE NOTE: You will need to add the value for "REACT_APP_API_URL" depending if you are working from Gitpod or local command line. If you're on Gitpod, copy the url you get after clicking "Open Browser" after running your API. IF you're working locally, copy the localhost url after running your API**

This will skip eslint pre-flight checks

**2.5.2** Next, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

**2.5.3** Then run `npm start` to run the code.

**2.5.4** Finally, navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your user interface.
