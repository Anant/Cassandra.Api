# Leaves.Astra Api (Python)

Python REST API using DataStax Astra with NoSQL, and Apache Cassandraâ„¢ in the cloud!

## Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For deployment to Gitpod: 

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/xingh/leaves.astra.git)

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7.17 or Python 3
- Python cassandra-driver
- Python requests
- Python flask

```sh
pip install cassandra-driver
pip install requests
pip install flask
```

### Setup (Locally)

- Create your database on DataStax Astra (Be sure to remmeber your keyspace name, username and password as those will be useful later on)
- Clone this repo
- Download the connection-details zip file from your Astra dashboard and place it in the "astra.credentials" folder.
- Add your credentials to the UserCred.json file in "leaves.astra/astra.credentials/" using the credentials you use to log in to the cql shell within astra as your username and password, and the name of your astra database under cluster
- Depending on the setup of your local machine's PATH, enviroment variable, you may need to edit lines 10, 13, 27 to inlcude the full paths for each file/folder the program is looking for.

```sh
line 10: with open('../../astra.credentials/UserCred.json') as f:
line 13: 'secure_connect_bundle': '../../astra.credentials/secure-connect-'+cred['cluster']+'.zip'
line 27: f = open('../../astra.import/schema/AstraTableDef')
```
- Make sure to run the importer first so that you have data in your database.

## Running the Program (Locally)

Run the script with the following command:
```sh
python app.py
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000/api/leaves` to view all of the data in your astra database table.

Navigate to `localhost:8000/api/leaves/(id)` to view a single row from your table with the proper id.

## Running the program on Gitpod

Run the script with the following command:
```
python astra.api/leaves.api.python/src/app.py
```

Gitpod will show a notice about port `8000` being open.
Open the port and also hit the "Browser" button, whcih will open a new tab which will likely point to a `404` page.
Add `/api/leaves` to the end of that url to view all of the data in your astra database table.
Add `/api/leaves/(id)` to view a single row from your table with the proper id.
